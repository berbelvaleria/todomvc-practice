# Playwright Automation - TodoMVC

This personal learning project consists of automated test cases for the public web application [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), using Playwright and JavaScript.

It includes both end-to-end flows and functional test cases focused on specific features such as task creation, editing, filtering, and deletion.

The goal was to practise modern automation tools, apply best practices in test structure, and simulate real user interactions in a realistic UI.



## 👨‍💻 Learning Journey

This is a personal learning project created as part of my transition from Manual QA to QA Automation.

I'm currently deepening my knowledge of Playwright and JavaScript, and using this project to practice good testing practices, build a clean test structure, and explore modern tools like HTML reporting and CI/CD pipelines.

It’s still a work in progress, and I plan to continue expanding the test coverage and improving the overall setup as I learn more.

## 🖼️ Report example, how to install Allure, and how to generate the report

[View an example report](https://github.com/berbelvaleria/todomvc-practice/blob/main/screenshots/report-v3.png)

To use the Allure CLI locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (with npm)
- Java JDK (OpenJDK)

### 🛠️ Installation and usage

```
# 1. Install Allure dependencies
npm install -D allure-playwright allure-commandline

# 2. Install Java (macOS using Homebrew)
brew install openjdk
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile 

# 3. Run Playwright tests to generate results
npx playwright test

# 4. Generate the Allure report
npx allure generate ./allure-results -o ./allure-report --clean

# 5. Open the report in your browser
npx allure open ./allure-report
```


## 🚧 Work in Progress / Next Steps

🔜 Upcoming improvements:
- Add negative and edge test cases
- Implement fixtures and test hooks
- Use custom test data
- Integrate Allure or other reporting tools
- Explore CI setup with GitHub Actions
